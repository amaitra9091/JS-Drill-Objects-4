In this function, taking an object as input (will be the same as the one
you returned in createDogObject()), update all the values with new values.
For example, you can update the the name of the object with:
obj.name = 'Corgo'
This changes the value of the name property to Corgo.
Do this for all the properties, and then return obj at the end.

Hint: you need to use the keyword `this` to access this property.
After adding the property, return the object.
